# SoFI Induction Portal - Detailed Assessment Answers

## Basic Questions Section

**1. A company reports ₹10 Cr depreciation expense. How does this impact each of the three financial statements? Explain the flow.**
*   **Income Statement:** Depreciation is an operating expense. It reduces Operating Income (EBIT) by ₹10 Cr. Assuming a tax rate of 25%, Net Income decreases by ₹7.5 Cr (₹10 Cr * (1 - 0.25)).
*   **Cash Flow Statement:** Net Income is the starting point for Cash Flow from Operations. Since depreciation is a non-cash expense, the ₹10 Cr is added back to Net Income. The net change in cash from this specific item is an increase of ₹2.5 Cr (the tax shield effect: ₹10 Cr * 25% tax rate).
*   **Balance Sheet:** 
    *   Assets: PP&E (Property, Plant, and Equipment) decreases by ₹10 Cr due to accumulated depreciation. Cash increases by ₹2.5 Cr (from the tax savings). Total changes in Assets = -₹7.5 Cr.
    *   Equity: Retained Earnings decreases by ₹7.5 Cr (due to the decrease in Net Income).
    *   Balance: Assets (-₹7.5 Cr) = Liabilities (0) + Equity (-₹7.5 Cr). The sheet balances.

**2. If a company's Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is consistently higher than Net Income, what does this indicate about the company's earnings quality and working capital management?**
*   **Earnings Quality:** This is generally a sign of high-quality earnings. It suggests that profits are backed by actual cash inflows rather than just accounting adjustments or aggressive revenue recognition (booking sales without collecting cash).
*   **Working Capital Management:** It indicates efficient working capital management. The company is likely collecting Receivables quickly, turning over Inventory efficiently, or utilizing Payables (supplier credit) effectively to preserve cash. It may also indicate significant non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization, which are common in capital-intensive industries.

**3. A company's current ratio is 2.5 and quick ratio is 0.8. What does this tell you about the company's liquidity position and inventory levels? Should this be a concern?**
*   **Analysis:** The Current Ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) is healthy at 2.5, but the Quick Ratio ((Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities) is low at 0.8. The large gap indicates that a significant portion of the company's current assets is tied up in **Inventory**.
*   **Concern:** This is a potential concern. It suggests the company relies heavily on selling inventory to meet short-term obligations. If the inventory is slow-moving, obsolete, or perishable, the company might face a liquidity crunch despite the high current ratio. However, for a retailer like a supermarket, this might be normal; for a software company, it would be a major red flag.

**4. Explain how a company can have positive net income but negative cash flow from operations. Provide two specific scenarios where this would occur.**
*   **Explanation:** Net Income is based on accrual accounting (revenue earned, expenses incurred), while Cash Flow looks at actual cash movement. A company can be profitable on paper but cash-poor.
*   **Scenario 1: Soaring Accounts Receivable:** The company is selling aggressively on credit to boost revenue numbers (booking 'Profit'), but customers haven't paid yet. Cash hasn't come in, but costs (wages, rent) are going out.
*   **Scenario 2: Massive Inventory Buildup:** The company spent a huge amount of cash to buy raw materials or produce goods that are sitting in the warehouse unsold. This cash outflow reduces CFO but doesn't immediately hurt Net Income until the goods are sold or written down.

**5. If a company's Debt-to-Equity ratio increases from 0.5 to 1.2 over two years while Return on Equity (ROE) increases from 12% to 18%, what does this suggest about the company's leverage strategy and financial risk?**
*   **Leverage Strategy:** The company is using financial leverage (debt) to boost returns for shareholders. By taking on more debt (increasing the D/E ratio), they are amplifying the ROE (DuPont Identity: Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage).
*   **Financial Risk:** The risk has increased significantly. The higher ROE is likely driven by the higher risk of debt closer to insolvency, rather than purely operational efficiency. If interest rates rise or earnings drop slightly, the high interest burden could wipe out profitability quickly. The company is trading safety for higher potential returns.

## Case Study Section

**1. Company A acquires Company B for ₹500 Cr. Company B's book value is ₹300 Cr. How would you account for the ₹200 Cr difference on Company A's balance sheet? What are the implications for future financial statements?**
*   **Accounting:** The ₹200 Cr difference is recorded as **Goodwill** (an intangible asset) on Company A's Balance Sheet. It represents the premium paid regarding brand reputation, customer lists, IP, etc.
*   **Implications:** 
    *   Goodwill is not amortized (gradually expensed) but is tested annually for **impairment**. 
    *   If Company B underperforms in the future, Company A may have to "write down" the Goodwill (Impairment Charge), which would appear as a massive one-time expense on the Income Statement, drastically reducing Net Income for that year.

**2. A manufacturing company shows ₹100 Cr inventory at year-end. During the year, raw material costs increased by 40%, but the company's gross margin remained stable. What questions would you ask as an analyst, and what red flags might this scenario indicate?**
*   **The Anomaly:** If costs rise by 40%, Gross Margin ((Rev - COGS)/Rev) should shrink unless sales prices were raised significantly. If margins are stable and prices didn't rise, something is wrong.
*   **Red Flags:** 
    *   **Inventory Inflation:** Is the company capitalizing operating costs into Inventory? By inflating the value of ending inventory, they reduce the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for the period, artificially boosting profits.
    *   **Obsolete Inventory:** Are they failing to write down old, devalued inventory?
*   **Questions:** "Did you raise product prices to offset the 40% cost hike?" "Have you changed your inventory valuation method (e.g., LIFO to FIFO)?"

**3. A tech startup has negative operating cash flow but is raising capital at increasing valuations. The company reports increasing revenue but flat gross margins. How would you assess whether this is a viable business model or a bubble?**
*   **Assessment:** Check **Unit Economics** (Lifetime Value of Customer > Customer Acquisition Cost).
*   **Scenario A (Viable):** Operating Cash Flow is negative because of massive upfront marketing to acquire customers who will be profitable over 5 years. Gross margins are positive, meaning the core product makes money. Operating leverage will kick in once growth slows.
*   **Scenario B (Bubble):** If Gross Margins are flat and barely positive, the company loses money on every unit sold after including fixed costs. If "Marketing" spent is actually just subsidizing the product price to fake growth (e.g., selling ₹100 product for ₹80), the business model is broken. Increasing valuation is driven by "hype" (Revenue growth) rather than fundamentals (path to profitability).

**4. Two retail companies have identical revenue (₹1000 Cr) and EBITDA (₹150 Cr), but Company X trades at 15x EBITDA while Company Y trades at 8x EBITDA. What factors could justify this valuation gap?**
*   **Growth Rate:** Company X is growing revenue at 20% YoY, while Company Y is stagnant at 2%. Investors pay a premium for growth.
*   **Capital Structure (Debt):** Company Y might have a huge debt load (high risk), making its equity less valuable, while Company X is debt-free.
*   **Capital Intensity (Capex):** Company X might be an e-commerce platform (asset-light, high Free Cash Flow conversion from EBITDA), while Company Y represents physical stores requiring heavy maintenance Capex (lower actual Free Cash Flow).
*   **Moat/Brand:** Company X has a strong loyal brand (pricing power), whereas Y is a commodity player.
